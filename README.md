# React Component Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications where a component fails to re-render after fetching data from an API, even when the data fetch is successful. The component remains stuck in a loading state.

## Problem Description

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from a hypothetical `/api/data` endpoint.  The API call works fine, and data is successfully retrieved. However, the component's UI does not reflect the updated data; it remains stuck displaying "Loading...".  This is likely caused by a missing dependency in the `useEffect` hook or improper state update logic.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `useEffect` hook correctly depends on the data and the error state, and that the state updates correctly reflect the data or error conditions.
